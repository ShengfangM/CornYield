# CornYield (Ongoing)

This repository is dedicated to evaluating the corn yield prediction results from existing machine learning models and constructing a high performance custom hybrid deep learning model for predicting corn yield.


The repository comprises four main sections:

**Data Preprocessing**: This section handles preprocessing of multispectral remote sensing data, addressing NaN values, standardizing image sizes, and partitioning the data into training-validation and test sets.

**Machine Learning (ML)**: Programs in this section establish machine learning pipelines utilizing algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Lasso from the scikit-learn library, facilitating model training and prediction.

**Deep Learning (DL)**: Here, programs are designed to utilize current deep learning architectures such as MLP-based models, CNN-based models, and vision-transformer based models, alongside custom designed hybrid models that fused CNN, MLP and transformer models, for training the corn yield prediction model.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics including R-square, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MRE (Mean Relative Error) are employed to assess the performance of the models.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developing, training, and evaluating corn yield prediction models, leveraging both traditional machine learning techniques and cutting-edge deep learning architectures.
